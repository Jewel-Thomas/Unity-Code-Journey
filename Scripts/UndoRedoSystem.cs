// Unity Design Pattern Example: UndoRedoSystem
// This script demonstrates the UndoRedoSystem pattern in Unity
// Generated automatically - ready to use in your Unity project

This C# Unity script provides a complete and practical implementation of the Undo/Redo design pattern. It includes a flexible `UndoRedoSystem` and example `ICommand` implementations for moving a `GameObject` and changing its color. The demo manager allows easy interaction via the Unity Editor's Context Menu.

---

### How to Use This Script in Unity:

1.  **Create a New C# Script**: In your Unity project, create a new C# script (e.g., right-click in Project window > Create > C# Script) and name it `UndoRedoDemoManager`.
2.  **Copy and Paste**: Copy the entire code below and paste it into your new `UndoRedoDemoManager.cs` file, overwriting its default contents.
3.  **Create a Target Object**: In your Unity scene, create a 3D object (e.g., `GameObject > 3D Object > Cube`). You can name it `UndoRedoTarget`.
4.  **Create an Empty GameObject**: Create an empty GameObject in your scene (e.g., `GameObject > Create Empty`). Name it something like `UndoRedoSystemManager`.
5.  **Attach the Script**: Drag and drop the `UndoRedoDemoManager.cs` script from your Project window onto the `UndoRedoSystemManager` GameObject in your Hierarchy.
6.  **Assign Target Object**: Select the `UndoRedoSystemManager` GameObject in the Hierarchy. In the Inspector, you will see a field named `Target Object`. Drag your `UndoRedoTarget` Cube (or any other GameObject with a `Renderer`) from the Hierarchy into this `Target Object` slot.
7.  **Run the Demo**:
    *   You can enter Play Mode to see the console logs.
    *   Select the `UndoRedoSystemManager` in the Hierarchy.
    *   In its Inspector, click the small **gear icon (â˜°)** next to the `UndoRedoDemoManager` component title.
    *   A context menu will appear with actions like "Execute: Move Object Randomly", "Undo Last Action", etc.
    *   Click these menu items to observe the `UndoRedoTarget` Cube moving and changing color, and how the undo/redo operations affect it. Watch the Console for detailed logs.

    // --- Example Usage in Comments ---
    /*
    This section illustrates how you would integrate the UndoRedoSystem into your own Unity project.

    1.  **Define Your Actions as Commands**:
        For every discrete action you want to be undoable/redoable, create a class that implements `ICommand`.
        This class should encapsulate all the logic and state needed to `Execute()` and `Unexecute()` that specific action.

        ```csharp
        public class MyCustomActionCommand : ICommand
        {
            private MyCustomData _targetData; // Reference to the object/data model being manipulated
            private object _oldState;         // State of _targetData before Execute()
            private object _newState;         // State of _targetData after Execute()

            public MyCustomActionCommand(MyCustomData targetData, object oldState, object newState)
            {
                _targetData = targetData;
                _oldState = oldState;
                _newState = newState;
            }

            public void Execute()
            {
                // Apply the new state to your data model or scene objects
                _targetData.ApplyState(_newState);
                Debug.Log("Custom action executed.");
            }

            public void Unexecute()
            {
                // Revert to the old state
                _targetData.ApplyState(_oldState);
                Debug.Log("Custom action undone.");
            }
        }
        ```

    2.  **Instantiate and Use the UndoRedoSystem**:
        In your game manager, editor tool, or any relevant class, create an instance of `UndoRedoSystem`.
        This is where you'll trigger the creation and execution of commands.

        ```csharp
        public class MyGameManager : MonoBehaviour
        {
            private UndoRedoSystem _gameUndoRedoSystem = new UndoRedoSystem();
            public MyCustomData gameData; // Example: A ScriptableObject or custom class holding game data

            // Example: A method called when a user performs an action
            public void UserChangesGameSetting(object newSettingValue)
            {
                object oldSettingValue = gameData.GetSetting(); // Capture current state BEFORE modification
                // Perform the actual change (e.g., gameData.SetSetting(newSettingValue);)
                // Then, create and execute the command:
                ICommand changeCommand = new MyCustomActionCommand(gameData, oldSettingValue, newSettingValue);
                _gameUndoRedoSystem.ExecuteCommand(changeCommand);
            }

            // Bind Undo/Redo to UI buttons or keyboard shortcuts (e.g., Ctrl+Z, Ctrl+Y):
            void Update()
            {
                // Example for Ctrl+Z (Undo)
                if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Z) && (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftControl) || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.RightControl)))
                {
                    _gameUndoRedoSystem.Undo();
                }
                // Example for Ctrl+Y (Redo)
                if (Input.GetKeyDown(KeyCode.Y) && (Input.GetKey(KeyCode.LeftControl) || Input.GetKey(KeyCode.RightControl)))
                {
                    _gameUndoRedoSystem.Redo();
                }
            }
        }
        ```

    3.  **Ensure State Capture**:
        When creating a command, it is critically important to capture the `oldState` *before* the actual modification occurs and *before* `Execute()` is called. The `newState` should represent the desired state after the command's execution. The `Execute()` method of the command then applies the `newState`, and `Unexecute()` applies the `oldState`. This ensures a faithful restoration of state.
