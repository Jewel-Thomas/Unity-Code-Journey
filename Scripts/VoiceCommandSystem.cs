// Unity Design Pattern Example: VoiceCommandSystem
// This script demonstrates the VoiceCommandSystem pattern in Unity
// Generated automatically - ready to use in your Unity project

The 'VoiceCommandSystem' design pattern, as conceptualized here, is an application of the **Command Pattern** combined with a mechanism for mapping "voice commands" (simulated as strings in Unity) to executable actions. It provides a flexible and extensible way to define, register, and execute commands based on user input, making it ideal for systems that need to respond to specific phrases or keywords.

**Key Components of the VoiceCommandSystem Pattern:**

1.  **`VoiceCommand` (Abstract Command):** An abstract base class or interface that defines the contract for all commands. It typically includes a `CommandPhrase` (the string that triggers the command) and an `Execute()` method (the action to be performed).

2.  **`ConcreteCommand` (Concrete Commands):** Specific implementations of the `VoiceCommand`. Each concrete command encapsulates a request as an object, including all information needed to perform the action. Examples: `ChangeColorCommand`, `MoveObjectCommand`, `LogMessageCommand`. These commands often have a "Receiver" â€“ an object that actually performs the work (e.g., a `Renderer` for color changes, a `Transform` for movement).

3.  **`VoiceCommandSystem` (Invoker/Processor):** This is the central hub. It maintains a collection (e.g., a dictionary) of registered `VoiceCommand` objects, mapped by their `CommandPhrase`. When it receives an "input phrase" (simulated voice input), it looks up the corresponding command and calls its `Execute()` method. It doesn't know *what* the command does, only that it has an `Execute()` method.

**Benefits:**

*   **Decoupling:** The `VoiceCommandSystem` (invoker) is decoupled from the `ConcreteCommand` (action) and the `Receiver` (object performing the action). New commands can be added without modifying the invoker.
*   **Extensibility:** Easily add new voice commands by creating new `ConcreteCommand` classes and registering them.
*   **Undo/Redo (Potential):** With slight modifications (e.g., adding an `Undo()` method to `VoiceCommand`), this pattern can support undo/redo functionality.
*   **Parameterization:** Commands can be parameterized with context-specific data at creation time.

/*
    =======================================================================================
    HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT IN UNITY:
    =======================================================================================

    1.  Create a new C# script named "VoiceCommandSystem.cs" in your Unity project.
    2.  Copy and paste the entire code above into this new script.
    3.  Create an Empty GameObject in your scene (e.g., right-click in Hierarchy -> Create Empty).
    4.  Rename this GameObject to "VoiceCommandSystemController".
    5.  Drag the "VoiceCommandSystem.cs" script onto the "VoiceCommandSystemController" GameObject in the Inspector.

    6.  Create a 3D Cube:
        - Right-click in Hierarchy -> 3D Object -> Cube.
        - Rename it to "MyCube".
        - In the Inspector of "VoiceCommandSystemController", drag "MyCube" from the Hierarchy
          into the "Cube Renderer" slot. The script will automatically find its Renderer component.

    7.  Create a 3D Sphere:
        - Right-click in Hierarchy -> 3D Object -> Sphere.
        - Rename it to "MySphere".
        - In the Inspector of "VoiceCommandSystemController", drag "MySphere" from the Hierarchy
          into the "Sphere Transform" slot. The script will automatically find its Transform component.

    8.  (Optional - For UI interaction):
        - Create a UI Input Field: Right-click in Hierarchy -> UI -> Input Field (TextMeshPro).
          (If you use TextMeshPro, import its essential resources when prompted).
        - Create a UI Button: Right-click in Hierarchy -> UI -> Button (TextMeshPro).
        - Select the "VoiceCommandSystemController" GameObject.
        - In its Inspector, you'll see a field "Simulated Input Phrase".
        - Select the Button GameObject in your scene.
        - In the Button's Inspector, find the "On Click ()" section.
        - Click the "+" button to add a new event.
        - Drag the "VoiceCommandSystemController" GameObject from the Hierarchy into the "None (Object)" slot.
        - From the dropdown menu that appears (next to "No Function"), navigate to:
          `DesignPatterns.VoiceCommandSystem` -> `VoiceCommandSystem` -> `ProcessSimulatedVoiceInput()`.

    9.  Run the scene:
        - If using the UI: Type a command (e.g., "change cube to red", "move sphere forward", "log hello", "show commands")
          into the Input Field and click the Button. Observe the console and the objects.
        - Without UI: You can directly type a command into the "Simulated Input Phrase" field
          in the Inspector of "VoiceCommandSystemController" while the game is running,
          and then click the "Process Simulated Input" button below it in the inspector
          (a custom editor would be needed to make a button appear, but simply changing the string
          and calling `ProcessSimulatedVoiceInput` from another script would work).

    EXAMPLE OF ADDING A CUSTOM COMMAND FROM ANOTHER SCRIPT AT RUNTIME:
    ------------------------------------------------------------------
    Let's say you have another script, `GameController.cs`:

    ```csharp
    using UnityEngine;
    using DesignPatterns.VoiceCommandSystem; // Don't forget this!

    public class GameController : MonoBehaviour
    {
        public VoiceCommandSystem voiceSystem;

        void Start()
        {
            if (voiceSystem != null)
            {
                // Register a new command at runtime
                voiceSystem.AddCustomRuntimeCommand("spawn effect", () => {
                    Debug.Log("Custom Command: Spawning a visual effect!");
                    // GameObject effect = Instantiate(myEffectPrefab, Vector3.zero, Quaternion.identity);
                    // Destroy(effect, 3f);
                });

                voiceSystem.AddCustomRuntimeCommand("quit game", () => {
                    Debug.Log("Custom Command: Quitting the application!");
                    Application.Quit();
                    #if UNITY_EDITOR
                    UnityEditor.EditorApplication.isPlaying = false;
                    #endif
                });

                Debug.Log("Added custom 'spawn effect' and 'quit game' commands dynamically.");
            }
            else
            {
                Debug.LogError("VoiceCommandSystem not assigned to GameController.");
            }
        }
    }
    ```
    - Attach `GameController.cs` to any GameObject.
    - Drag the "VoiceCommandSystemController" GameObject into the `voiceSystem` slot of `GameController`'s Inspector.
    - Now, when you run the game and input "spawn effect" or "quit game", these new commands will be recognized!
