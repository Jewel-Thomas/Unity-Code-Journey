// Unity Design Pattern Example: AutoBalancingDifficulty
// This script demonstrates the AutoBalancingDifficulty pattern in Unity
// Generated automatically - ready to use in your Unity project

The 'AutoBalancingDifficulty' design pattern dynamically adjusts the game's difficulty based on the player's performance. This ensures the game remains challenging without becoming unfairly difficult, or too easy and boring.

This example provides a complete C# Unity script that implements this pattern. It tracks player performance, evaluates it against configurable thresholds, and smoothly transitions the game's difficulty. Other game elements can then query this manager to adapt their behavior (e.g., enemy speed, health, spawn rates).

---

### `AutoBalancingDifficultyManager.cs`

This is the core script. Create a new C# script named `AutoBalancingDifficultyManager.cs` in your Unity project and paste the following code into it.

```csharp
using UnityEngine;
using System.Collections; // Not strictly needed for this specific script, but often used in Unity projects

/// <summary>
///     The AutoBalancingDifficultyManager implements the Auto-Balancing Difficulty design pattern.
///     This pattern dynamically adjusts the game's difficulty based on the player's performance.
///     It aims to keep the player engaged by preventing the game from becoming too easy (leading to boredom)
///     or too hard (leading to frustration).
///
///     How it works:
///     1.  **Performance Tracking:** A metric (`_currentPlayerPerformanceScore`) tracks the player's
///         recent success/failure rate.
///     2.  **Thresholds:** If the performance score goes above an 'increase' threshold, the game starts
///         targeting a harder difficulty. If it drops below a 'decrease' threshold, it targets an easier difficulty.
///     3.  **Smooth Transition:** The actual continuous difficulty value (`_currentDifficultyValue`)
///         smoothly interpolates towards the target difficulty, avoiding abrupt changes.
///     4.  **Difficulty Application:** Game elements (enemy speed, health, spawn rate, etc.) query this
///         manager for current modifiers and adjust their behavior accordingly.
/// </summary>

### Example Usage in Other Scripts

To demonstrate how other parts of your game would interact with `AutoBalancingDifficultyManager`, here are two example scripts.

#### 1. `Example_Enemy.cs`

This script would be attached to your enemy prefabs. It shows how enemies report player performance and how they can adapt their stats based on the current difficulty.

```csharp
// Example_Enemy.cs
using UnityEngine;

public class Example_Enemy : MonoBehaviour
{
    public float baseSpeed = 5f;
    public float baseHealth = 100f;

    private AutoBalancingDifficultyManager _difficultyManager;
    private float _currentHealth;
    private float _currentSpeed;

    void Start()
    {
        // Find the difficulty manager in the scene.
        // In a larger project, consider using a Singleton pattern for AutoBalancingDifficultyManager
        // for easier and safer access, or inject the reference.
        _difficultyManager = FindObjectOfType<AutoBalancingDifficultyManager>();
        if (_difficultyManager == null)
        {
            Debug.LogError("AutoBalancingDifficultyManager not found in scene for Example_Enemy! " +
                           "Please add it to a GameObject in the scene.");
            enabled = false; // Disable this script if manager is missing
            return;
        }

        // Apply initial difficulty modifiers to this enemy's stats.
        ApplyDifficultyToEnemyStats();
        _currentHealth = baseHealth * _difficultyManager.EnemyHealthModifier; // Set initial health
    }

    void Update()
    {
        // Example: Move enemy based on current speed, which is modified by difficulty.
        transform.position += transform.forward * _currentSpeed * Time.deltaTime;

        // In a real game, you might want enemies to dynamically adjust to difficulty changes
        // while they are alive. This could be done by re-calling ApplyDifficultyToEnemyStats()
        // if an event from the DifficultyManager signals a change, or periodically.
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Simulates the enemy taking damage.
    /// </summary>
    public void TakeDamage(float amount)
    {
        _currentHealth -= amount;
        Debug.Log($"Enemy took {amount} damage. Current Health: {_currentHealth:F1}");

        if (_currentHealth <= 0)
        {
            Die();
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Called when the enemy is defeated. Reports success to the difficulty manager.
    /// </summary>
    void Die()
    {
        if (_difficultyManager != null)
        {
            _difficultyManager.ReportPlayerSuccess(); // Player defeated an enemy! Report success.
            Debug.Log($"Enemy defeated! Reported success. Current Difficulty: {_difficultyManager.CurrentDifficultyLevel}");
        }
        Destroy(gameObject); // Remove enemy from scene
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Called when the player gets hit by this enemy. Reports failure to the difficulty manager.
    /// </summary>
    void OnCollisionEnter(Collision collision)
    {
        if (collision.gameObject.CompareTag("Player"))
        {
            if (_difficultyManager != null)
            {
                _difficultyManager.ReportPlayerFailure(); // Player got hit! Report failure.
                Debug.Log($"Player hit by enemy! Reported failure. Current Difficulty: {_difficultyManager.CurrentDifficultyLevel}");
            }
            // ... Logic to deal damage to the player character ...
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Applies the current difficulty modifiers from the manager to this enemy's stats.
    /// </summary>
    void ApplyDifficultyToEnemyStats()
    {
        if (_difficultyManager != null)
        {
            // Modify speed and health based on the difficulty manager's current values.
            _currentSpeed = baseSpeed * _difficultyManager.EnemySpeedModifier;
            _currentHealth = baseHealth * _difficultyManager.EnemyHealthModifier; // Note: This might reset health if called repeatedly.
            Debug.Log($"Enemy stats adjusted. Speed: {_currentSpeed:F2}, Health: {_currentHealth:F2} " +
                      $"(Difficulty: {_difficultyManager.CurrentDifficultyLevel})");
        }
    }
}
```

#### 2. `Example_EnemySpawner.cs`

This script demonstrates how a spawner can use the difficulty manager's `SpawnRateModifier` to control how often enemies appear.

```csharp
// Example_EnemySpawner.cs
using UnityEngine;

public class Example_EnemySpawner : MonoBehaviour
{
    public GameObject enemyPrefab;
    public Transform[] spawnPoints; // Array of points where enemies can spawn
    public float baseSpawnInterval = 5f; // Time between spawns at default difficulty

    private AutoBalancingDifficultyManager _difficultyManager;
    private float _spawnTimer;

    void Start()
    {

        if (_difficultyManager == null)
        {
            Debug.LogError("AutoBalancingDifficultyManager not found in scene for Example_EnemySpawner! " +
                           "Please add it to a GameObject in the scene.");
            enabled = false;
            return;
        }

        if (spawnPoints == null || spawnPoints.Length == 0)
        {
            Debug.LogError("No spawn points assigned to Example_EnemySpawner!");
            enabled = false;
            return;
        }

        _spawnTimer = GetCurrentSpawnInterval(); // Initialize timer based on current difficulty
    }

    void Update()
    {
        _spawnTimer -= Time.deltaTime;

        if (_spawnTimer <= 0)
        {
            SpawnEnemy();
            _spawnTimer = GetCurrentSpawnInterval(); // Reset timer with potentially new interval
        }
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Calculates the current spawn interval, adjusted by the difficulty manager's modifier.
    /// </summary>
    /// <returns>The time in seconds until the next enemy should spawn.</returns>
    float GetCurrentSpawnInterval()
    {
        if (_difficultyManager != null)
        {
            // Apply the spawn rate modifier.
            // If modifier is 0.6 (easier), interval becomes base / 0.6 (slower spawn).
            // If modifier is 1.4 (harder), interval becomes base / 1.4 (faster spawn).
            return baseSpawnInterval / _difficultyManager.SpawnRateModifier;
        }
        return baseSpawnInterval; // Default if manager is not found
    }

    /// <summary>
    /// Spawns an enemy at a random spawn point.
    /// </summary>
    void SpawnEnemy()
    {
        int randomSpawnPointIndex = Random.Range(0, spawnPoints.Length);
        Transform spawnLocation = spawnPoints[randomSpawnPointIndex];

        GameObject newEnemy = Instantiate(enemyPrefab, spawnLocation.position, spawnLocation.rotation);

        // Optional: If the enemy's stats need to be set at spawn time (and not just in its own Start()),
        // you can pass modifiers here.
        // Example: if (newEnemy.TryGetComponent<Example_Enemy>(out var enemy))
        // {

### Setup in Unity

1.  **Create an Empty GameObject:** In your Unity scene, create an empty GameObject (e.g., right-click in the Hierarchy -> "Create Empty"). Name it `DifficultyManager`.
2.  **Attach `AutoBalancingDifficultyManager`:** Drag and drop the `AutoBalancingDifficultyManager.cs` script onto the `DifficultyManager` GameObject in the Hierarchy or Inspector.
3.  **Configure in Inspector:** Select the `DifficultyManager` GameObject. In its Inspector panel, you'll see all the configurable parameters (`Difficulty Settings`, `Player Performance Tracking`, `Demonstration Settings`).
    *   **Keep `_simulatePlayerActions` enabled** initially to see the system work automatically. Observe the console logs as the difficulty changes.
    *   Adjust thresholds and speeds to see how they affect the balancing.
4.  **Create Enemy Prefab:**
    *   Create a simple 3D object (e.g., a Cube, Sphere) in your scene.
    *   Add a `Rigidbody` component to it (uncheck "Use Gravity" if you don't want it to fall).
    *   Add a `Capsule Collider` or `Box Collider` and mark it as a Trigger if you prefer trigger-based detection for "player hit."
    *   Add a `Tag` named "Player" to your actual player GameObject for the `OnCollisionEnter` check in `Example_Enemy`.
    *   Attach the `Example_Enemy.cs` script to this GameObject.
    *   Drag this GameObject from the Hierarchy into your Project window to create a prefab. Delete the instance from the scene.
5.  **Create Spawner GameObject:**
    *   Create another empty GameObject named `EnemySpawner`.
    *   Attach the `Example_EnemySpawner.cs` script to it.
    *   Assign your `enemyPrefab` to the "Enemy Prefab" slot in the Inspector.
    *   Create a few empty GameObjects in your scene (e.g., at different positions) and drag them into the "Spawn Points" array in the `EnemySpawner`'s Inspector.

Now, run your Unity scene. You should see console logs from the `AutoBalancingDifficultyManager` indicating changes in player performance and difficulty. The `Example_EnemySpawner` will start spawning enemies, and if you interact with them (or have simulated hits/kills), the `Example_Enemy` script will report successes/failures, influencing the overall game difficulty.
