// Unity Design Pattern Example: WallRunSystem
// This script demonstrates the WallRunSystem pattern in Unity
// Generated automatically - ready to use in your Unity project

This example demonstrates the **'WallRunSystem' design pattern** in Unity, which refers to creating a dedicated, modular system to manage a specific game mechanic â€“ in this case, wall running. This approach promotes the Single Responsibility Principle, making your code cleaner, more maintainable, and easier to extend.

The `WallRunSystem` script handles all aspects of wall detection, initiating the wall run, managing movement and gravity during the run, and handling a wall jump. Other player movement systems can then integrate with it by querying its state (`IsWallRunning()`) and deferring control when necessary.

    // --- Example Usage Comments and Design Pattern Explanation ---
    /*
     * How to use the WallRunSystem in a Unity Project:
     *
     * 1. Create a Player GameObject:
     *    - Create an empty GameObject (e.g., 'GameObject -> Create Empty'), name it "Player".
     *    - Add a `CharacterController` component to it (select "Player", then 'Add Component -> Physics -> Character Controller').
     *    - Add this `WallRunSystem.cs` script to the "Player" GameObject ('Add Component -> Scripts -> Wall Run System').
     *
     * 2. Configure the WallRunSystem in the Inspector:
     *    - Drag your Main Camera (or its child that represents the player's view) into the 'Player Camera Transform' field.
     *    - Set the 'Wall Run Layer' to a LayerMask that includes your wall GameObjects (see step 5).
     *    - Adjust 'Wall Run Speed', 'Wall Run Jump Force', 'Wall Run Max Duration', 'Wall Check Distance', etc., to fine-tune the mechanic.
     *
     * 3. Create Walls in your Scene:
     *    - Create 3D Cube GameObjects (e.g., 'GameObject -> 3D Object -> Cube') and position them to act as walls.
     *
     * 4. Setup Layers for Walls:
     *    - Go to `Edit -> Project Settings -> Tags and Layers`.
     *    - Add a new Layer (e.g., at an empty slot, name it "Wall").
     *    - Select your wall GameObjects in the Hierarchy and, in the Inspector, change their Layer dropdown to "Wall".
     *    - Back on your "Player" GameObject, in the `WallRunSystem` component, set the 'Wall Run Layer' field to "Wall".
     *
     * 5. Integrate with your PlayerMovement script (RECOMMENDED for robust player control):
     *    - If you have a separate `PlayerMovement` script, it should integrate with `WallRunSystem`
     *      to avoid conflicting movement logic. The `WallRunSystem` takes over completely during a wall run.
     *
     *    Example `PlayerMovement.cs` Integration:

     * Design Pattern Explanation: The 'WallRunSystem' Pattern
     * The 'WallRunSystem' here embodies the "System" design pattern common in game development,
     * particularly related to component-based architectures.
     *
     * 1.  Single Responsibility Principle (SRP): The `WallRunSystem` is solely responsible for wall running.
     *     It doesn't handle general player movement, input collection for non-wall-run actions, or health management.
     *     This keeps the code focused and manageable.
     *
     * 2.  Decoupling: It's decoupled from the main `PlayerMovement` script. The `PlayerMovement` doesn't
     *     need to know *how* wall running works internally; it only needs to know *if* the player is wall running
     *     (`IsWallRunning()`) and then hands off control. This allows both systems to be developed and modified
     *     independently.
     *
     * 3.  Composability: It's designed as a MonoBehaviour component that can be added to any GameObject with a
     *     `CharacterController`. This makes it reusable across different player characters or even for AI if needed.
     *     It "composes" functionality onto an existing entity.
     *
     * 4.  Maintainability and Extensibility: All wall run logic (detection, movement, exit conditions, jump) is
     *     centralized. If you want to change how wall running feels or add new features (e.g., wall run stamina,
     *     different wall run types), you only need to modify this one script.
     *
     * 5.  Clarity: The presence of `WallRunSystem` clearly signals what that component does, improving code readability
     *     and understanding for anyone working on the project.
     *
     * This 'System' pattern is a practical and educational way to structure complex game mechanics, making them robust and flexible.
